\chapter{Derivatives}
One of the most important concepts in calculus is the derivative. The derivative of a function is a measure of how the function changes as its input changes. It tells us how the function is changing at any given point, and it is used to solve a wide variety of problems in mathematics, science, and engineering.

\begin{example} 
    {Example 3.9}
    \[T'(3)=\lim{t \to 3}\frac{T(t)-T(3)}{t-3}\]
\end{example}

\section{Derivative as a Function}
This is from section 3.2

\begin{definition} 
    {Derivative Function}
    Let \(f\) be a function. The derivative function, denoted by \(f'\), of \(x\) such tha that the following limit exists: 
    \[f'(x)=\lim{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.\]
\end{definition}
